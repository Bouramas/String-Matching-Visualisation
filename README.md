# String Matching Algorithms Visualisations

This repository contains visualisations of various string matching algorithms, created as part of my Master's Degree in Software Development at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. This project was developed as my final project, showcasing step-by-step visualisations of string-matching algorithms. Upon completion the app was used as a course companion for the Algorithms course in the University.
